# Week 17A Contact List
Repository for the Contact list task.

# Description

1. Create a web based contact list which can show multiple contacts' info in one page. Every contact has the following properties:
 - FirstName
 - LastName
 - City
 - Address
 - Email
 - Phone
2. Every contact item should appear in a business card format.
3. To generate random test data use the public API at www.filltext.com.
4. Create a new object in your javascript file named Contact which can store all the data of a particular contact so you can parse the JSON data into this.
5. Use XMLHttpRequest to get the data from the API.
